# üìå About the Project 
This project was conducted as part of the **Time Series Analysis course** at **Rennes School of Business**. It focuses on analyzing the historical stock prices of **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, 2330.TW)** ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest and most advanced semiconductor foundry.

Given TSMC‚Äôs key role in global technology supply chains and Taiwan‚Äôs economy, we aimed to explore long-term price trends and forecast future stock movements using multiple time series models. The insights drawn from this analysis have implications for investment strategies, economic forecasting, and risk management in the tech sector.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Monthly closing price data (2015‚Äì2024) from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed for time series analysis.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visual trend inspection, KPSS and ACF tests to assess stationarity and seasonality.
4. **Modeling**:
   - **Simple/Weighted Moving Averages (SMA/WMA)**
   - **ARIMA**
   - **Exponential Smoothing (SES, Holt)**
   - **Prophet**
5. **Model Evaluation**: Forecast accuracy measured with **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **MAPE** using a hold-out test set of 30 months.
6. **Selection**: The best-performing model was identified based on the lowest RMSE.
7. **Future Forecast**: To extend our analysis beyond the testing phase, we retrained all models on the entire 10-year dataset and generated forecasts for the next 24 months (Jan 2025 ‚Äì Dec 2026).


## ‚úÖ Conclusions

- **TSMC‚Äôs stock price shows strong long-term growth**, supported by trends in AI and high-performance computing demand.
- **Prophet had the best RMSE**, while **ARIMA offered the best MAPE**, making both valuable depending on forecasting goals.
- **Volatility remains a short-term risk**, reinforcing the need for multi-model forecasting and scenario planning.
- Recommended investment horizon: **medium to long-term (6‚Äì24 months)**.
- The resulting forecasts were visualized and compared with actual values, offering a comprehensive view of each model‚Äôs forward-looking performance. The visualization highlights:
   - ARIMA and Prophet both captured the long-term growth trend effectively.
   - Prophet demonstrated smooth and consistent projections, which are ideal for capturing non-linear trends.
